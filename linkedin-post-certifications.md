🎉 **Excited to share that I've earned two Microsoft certifications!**

I'm thrilled to announce that I've recently earned:
✅ **Power BI Data Analyst Associate**
✅ **Azure Database Administrator Associate**

These certifications validate my expertise in business intelligence and cloud database management—skills that are essential in my work with financial analytics, fraud detection, and large-scale data processing.

**Why these certifications matter:**
• Power BI enables me to create executive-ready dashboards for financial KPIs and compliance reporting
• Azure Database Administrator certification validates my understanding of secure, scalable cloud data infrastructure
• Both complement my work with Databricks, Python, SQL, and Tableau in enterprise environments

In data science, continuous learning is key. These certifications represent my commitment to staying current with industry-standard tools and technologies, especially in Microsoft's ecosystem which many financial institutions rely on.

I've written a detailed blog post about why these certifications matter for data science professionals, how they complement my work in financial analytics, and what the certification journey taught me.
