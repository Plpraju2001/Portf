🎉 Excited to share that I've renewed two Microsoft certifications!

✅ Power BI Data Analyst Associate
✅ Azure Database Administrator Associate

Renewing these certifications demonstrates my commitment to staying current with the latest tools and technologies in business intelligence and cloud database management—skills that are essential in my work with financial analytics, fraud detection, and large-scale data processing.

Why these certifications matter:
• Power BI enables me to create executive-ready dashboards for financial KPIs and compliance reporting
• Azure Database Administrator certification validates my understanding of secure, scalable cloud data infrastructure
• Both complement my work with Databricks, Python, SQL, and Tableau in enterprise environments

In data science, continuous learning is key. These certifications represent my commitment to staying current with industry-standard tools and technologies, especially in Microsoft's ecosystem which many financial institutions rely on.

I've written a detailed blog post about why these certifications matter for data science professionals, how they complement my work in financial analytics, and what the certification journey taught me.
