## Will It Affect Your Site?

- Cursor connects to GitHub using your personal access token
- Private repositories work the same as public ones
- All push/pull/deploy functionality continues normally

### ✅ Deployment Unaffected
- GitHub Actions workflows continue running
- Automatic deployment on push still works
- Your site stays live

## Benefits of Private Repository

✅ **Privacy** - Your code and commits aren't publicly visible
✅ **Clean Profile** - No portfolio repos cluttering your GitHub profile
✅ **Professional** - Shows you care about code privacy
✅ **Site Still Public** - Your portfolio website remains accessible to everyone

## Important Notes

- You need to have **GitHub Pro** or be on **GitHub Team** for free private repositories with GitHub Pages (free plan has limited private repos)
- Your **website stays completely public** - only the code is private
- Visitors can't see your source code, git history, or issues
- You can change it back to public anytime if needed

## Conclusion

**Yes, you should definitely make it private!** It's the professional thing to do - keep your portfolio code private while your website remains public for everyone to see.
