# Check GitHub Pages Status

## Next Steps

1. **Go to GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/Plpraju2001/Portf/actions

2. **You should see a workflow running** called "Deploy to GitHub Pages"

3. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for it to complete

4. **Check if it succeeded**:
   - ✅ Green checkmark = Site is deploying
   - ❌ Red X = Something went wrong

## Verify Site is Live

After the GitHub Actions workflow completes (about 3-5 minutes), try:
- https://lakshmipathirajup.com
- Wait a few minutes if still 404

## If Still Not Working

**Check GitHub Pages Settings:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Plpraju2001/Portf/settings/pages
2. Make sure:
   - Source is set to **"GitHub Actions"**
   - Custom domain shows: **lakshmipathirajup.com**
   - Enforce HTTPS is enabled

**Still issues?** Let me know what you see on the Actions page!
