# What Those Effects Mean

## Reading the GitHub Modal

When you click "Make private", GitHub shows some effects. Here's what they mean:

### 1. "Custom Dependabot alert rules will be disabled"
**What it means:** If you had special security alerts set up, those will stop
**Should you care?** No, for a portfolio site this doesn't matter
**Your action:** You can ignore this

### 2. "Current forks will remain public and will be detached"
**What it means:** If anyone forked your repo, their forks stay public but won't get updates from you
**Should you care?** Only if someone forked it (unlikely for a portfolio)
**Your action:** You can ignore this

### 3. "Advanced Security will be disabled"
**What it means:** GitHub's premium security features turn off
**Should you care?** No, unless you were paying for advanced security
**Your action:** You can ignore this

## The Bottom Line

✅ **Click "I have read and understand these effects"**

All these warnings are just standard GitHub messages. For a portfolio website, none of them are important. Your site will:
- ✅ Stay live at lakshmipathirajup.com
- ✅ Keep working with GitHub Pages
- ✅ Continue deploying automatically
- ✅ Work perfectly with Cursor

The ONLY thing that changes is:
- Your code becomes private (people can't browse your source code on GitHub)
- Your website stays completely public

## Next Steps

1. Click the blue button: **"I have read and understand these effects"**
2. Your repo becomes private
3. Everything continues working exactly as before!
4. People can still visit lakshmipathirajup.com and see your portfolio

**It's safe - go ahead and make it private!** 🚀
