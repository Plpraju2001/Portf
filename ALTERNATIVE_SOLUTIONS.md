# Alternative Solutions for Privacy

## Option 1: Use Vercel (Recommended - Best Privacy)

**How it works:**
- Connect your private GitHub repo to Vercel
- Vercel deploys automatically on every push
- Your repo stays completely private
- Website is public at lakshmipathirajup.com

**Steps:**
1. Go to vercel.com
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Import your Portf repository (private!)
4. Add custom domain: lakshmipathirajup.com
5. Done!

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Repo stays private
- ✅ Better performance than GitHub Pages
- ✅ Free hosting
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS
- ✅ Easy to use

## Option 2: Use Netlify (Alternative)

**How it works:**
- Similar to Vercel
- Connect private GitHub repo
- Automatic deployments
- Free hosting

**Steps:**
1. Go to netlify.com
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Import Portf repo
4. Add custom domain

## Option 3: Keep GitHub Pages + Separate Deploy Repo

**How it works:**
- Keep main repo private
- Create a separate public repo just for deployments
- Copy built files to public repo
- GitHub Pages serves from public repo

**Pros:** Main code stays private
**Cons:** More complex, two repos to manage

## Option 4: Just Make It Public (Simplest)

**Reality check:**
- Your portfolio code isn't valuable IP
- Thousands of portfolio templates are public
- Standard industry practice
- Saves you complexity

## My Recommendation

**Use Vercel** - it's the easiest solution that:
- Keeps your repo private
- Gives you better hosting
- Works seamlessly with Cursor
- Is completely free
