# Monitor GitHub Actions Deployment

## Check the Latest Run

1. Go to: **https://github.com/Plpraju2001/Portf/actions**

2. The most recent run should be: **"Fix GitHub Pages workflow permissions"**

3. Wait **2-5 minutes** for it to complete

4. Look for status:
   - ✅ **Green checkmark** = SUCCESS! Site is deploying
   - ❌ **Red X** = Still failed, need to troubleshoot more

## What Was Fixed

Added permissions to the build job in the workflow file. This should resolve the deployment failure.

## If It Works

✅ Your site will be back online at **lakshmipathirajup.com** within 5-10 minutes!

## If It Still Fails

Share a screenshot of the error log and I'll investigate further.

Let me know what you see!
