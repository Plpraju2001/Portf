# GitHub Projects Restored!

## What Was Done

Restored GitHub project fetching on your portfolio with filters to exclude unwanted repos.

### Implemented Features

1. **Automatic GitHub Fetching** - Your projects are now fetched from GitHub automatically
2. **Filtering** - Excludes these unwanted repositories:
   - `raju-portfolio`
   - `cursor`
   - `portf`
3. **Project Pages** - Each project has its own detail page with:
   - Overview section
   - GitHub link at the bottom
   - Technologies, features, challenges, and solutions

### Current Projects Showing

**Predefined Projects:**
- Advanced Causal Inference Framework
- Real-time Customer Churn Prediction System
- Marketing Mix Modeling Platform
- Advanced A/B Testing Platform

**GitHub Repositories** (All others except raju-portfolio, cursor, portf):
Your actual GitHub projects will automatically appear on the homepage!

### How It Works

1. **Homepage** - Fetches all GitHub repos and filters out the 3 unwanted ones
2. **Project Pages** - Each project gets its own page with overview and GitHub link
3. **Automatic Updates** - When you push to GitHub, your portfolio updates automatically

## Deployment

⏳ GitHub Pages deployment in progress (2-5 minutes)
